# Specification Quality Checklist: VPN 产品官网

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ Content Quality - PASSED

All requirements focus on user value and business outcomes without specifying technical implementation. The specification is written in clear language suitable for non-technical stakeholders.

Note: The "假设与约束" section mentions specific technologies (Next.js, React, TypeScript, etc.) but this is appropriate as it references the project's constitutional constraints, not introducing new implementation decisions for this feature.

### ✅ Requirement Completeness - PASSED

- All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-012) are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-010) are measurable with specific metrics
- All success criteria are technology-agnostic and focus on user-facing outcomes
- User scenarios include comprehensive acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format
- Edge cases are identified covering JavaScript disabled, slow networks, old browsers, etc.
- Scope is clearly defined with "包含在范围内" and "不包含在范围内" sections
- Assumptions and constraints are documented

### ✅ Feature Readiness - PASSED

- Each user story includes clear acceptance scenarios that serve as test criteria
- Three user stories cover the primary user flows (browsing product info, switching language, contacting)
- All success criteria define measurable outcomes from user perspective
- No implementation details leak into the specification (constraint references are appropriate)

## Notes

**Specification Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

This specification is complete and meets all quality criteria. It can proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase.

**Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories with justification
- Comprehensive success criteria with specific metrics
- Well-defined scope boundaries
- Good coverage of edge cases and accessibility requirements
- All content is technology-agnostic (except constitutional constraints)

**No issues found** - Specification is ready for implementation planning.
